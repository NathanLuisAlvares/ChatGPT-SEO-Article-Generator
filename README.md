# ChatGPT-SEO-Article-Generator
Making a SEO article generator using ChatGPT with StreamLit

### Step 1: Install Anaconda by downloading the latest version from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

### Step 2: Install the dependencies by opening your command prompt or terminal application. (Note: I used VS Code)
1. OpenAI
```bash
pip install openai --user
```

2. Streamlit
```bash
pip install streamlit --user
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the directory where your app's code is stored using the command prompt or terminal application.

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit app by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### NOTE:- In this line of code:
```bash
openai.api_key = "Paste your api here"
```
You need your API key from ChatGPT. Do the following steps:
1. Go to https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt
2. Click the dropdown: "Developers" -> "API Reference"
3. Click the top-right icon which is your account. If not signed in, please do so to proceed to the next step.
4. Then in the dropdown of your icon, click "View API keys".
5. Create new secret key and copy-paste the API key in the above line of code.
